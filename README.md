# Predicting Home Prices Using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting house prices based on various features using different machine learning algorithms. The objective is to build a model that can accurately predict the price of a house based on its attributes such as size, location, and amenities.

## Project Structure
- **`Predicting_Home_Prices_using_Machine_Learning.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data exploration, preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
- **`/data`**: Directory for storing the dataset.
- **`/models`**: Directory where trained models will be saved.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Size**: The size of the house in square feet.
- **Number of Bedrooms**: Total number of bedrooms.
- **Number of Bathrooms**: Total number of bathrooms.
- **Location**: The neighborhood or city.
- **Additional Features**: Information on amenities like a balcony, etc.
- **Price**: The target variable representing the house's market price.

## Machine Learning Models
The following machine learning models are implemented in the project:

- **Linear Regression**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Lasso**
  
Each model is trained, and their performances are compared using evaluation metrics.
